    "Willhaben.at, as Austria’s largest classifieds website, is a rich source of data for market analysis, especially in real estate, automobiles, and second-hand goods. However, scraping Willhaben can be challenging due to dynamic content loading and bot protection. A robust approach involves using Scrapy for structured scraping logic, with Selenium integrated as middleware to render JavaScript and bypass basic anti-bot defenses.\n",

    "### 🛠 Tools & Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scrapy**: Python-based web crawling framework for structured data extraction.\n",

    "* **Selenium**: Browser automation tool to handle JavaScript-rendered pages.\n",
